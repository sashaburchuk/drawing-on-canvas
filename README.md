# drawing-on-canvas

I love interactive design and I wanted to see how drawing paths on canvas works in preparation for playing with some svg and webgl libraries. 

Here are just a few svgs that I drew to canvas using raw JS to practice using arcs and bezier curves and quadratic curves. 

The heart and smiley face I borrowed from MDN's tutorial on the Canvas API.

The diamond, cut gem, and cat face I created myself. 

Use them if you want!
